## HomeLab

This repository is the source of truth for my Kubernetes Homelab. I use the configuration files here to manage infrastructure such as the kubernetes clusters and the applications I host in them.

## Contents

1. `applications` -- Containerised workloads running in Kubernetes
1. `infrastructure` -- Code and config files to set up the homelab infrastructure. Includes ansible playbooks.
